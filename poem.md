# The Developer's Dawn

In the quiet hours before the world awakes,
When screens glow softly in the morning light,
A developer sits with coffee that breaks
The silence of code that runs through the night.

Lines of logic dance across the page,
Functions and variables come alive,
Each bracket, each semicolon on stage
In the symphony where algorithms thrive.

Debugging sessions stretch like winding roads,
Error messages flash like warning signs,
But persistence pays as understanding unfolds,
And suddenly everything perfectly aligns.

From concept to deployment, dreams take flight,
In languages that speak to silicon hearts,
Creating solutions that make the world bright,
Where science and imagination never part.

So here's to the builders of digital dreams,
Who craft the future one keystroke at a time,
In the endless flow of data streams,
Making the impossible sublime.
